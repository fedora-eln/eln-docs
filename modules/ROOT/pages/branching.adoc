= ELN Branching Events +

== Fedora Branching ==
Fedora Branching happens every 6 months, when Fedora Rawhide branches for the next release.  Example:  When Fedora Rawhide is branched to F35 and fedora-release is set to f36.

=== Trigger for ELN Pipeline ===

The eln build trigger needs to be updated to the latest version that is in fedora-release.  Using our original example.  We would change this to f36.

Example pull request: https://github.com/fedora-ci/eln-build-trigger/pull/2

=== ELN fedora release and repo ===

==== Check fedora-release ====

After Fedora branching has happened, and fedora-release has been updated and built for the new version, check the fedora-release rpm spec file.  Verify that ```rhel_dist_version``` is set to the correct version.

The fedora-release check is especially important if this is the fedora branching that corresponds to a RHEL version change.

==== Build fedora-release first ====

```
koji tag-build eln fedora-release-35-0.1
koji wait-repo eln-build --build fedora-release-35-0.1
# build fedora-release for ELN
# Example: fedpkg build --skip-nvr-check --target eln
koji wait-repo eln-build --build fedora-release-35-0.1.eln110
koji untag-build eln fedora-release-35-0.1
```

==== Build fedora-repos after fedora-release is in buildroot ====

```
koji tag-build eln fedora-repos-35-0.2
koji wait-repo eln-build --build fedora-repos-35-0.2
# build fedora-repos for ELN
# Example: fedpkg build --skip-nvr-check --target eln
koji wait-repo eln-build --build fedora-repos-35-0.2.eln110
koji untag-build eln fedora-repos-35-0.2
```

== RHEL Branching ==

RHEL Branching happens every 3 years, when RHEL branches for the next release.  Example:  When RHEL is branched to RHEL 10.
