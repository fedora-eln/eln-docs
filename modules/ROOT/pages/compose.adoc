= Fedora ELN compose =

== Summary ==

The Fedora ELN compose is built using the ODCS (On Demand Compose Service). There are two ODCS
instances (production and staging) and therefore two places with the latest ELN composes:

|===
|Fedora ELN compose | Environment | Link

|Latest periodic | production | https://odcs.fedoraproject.org/composes/production/latest-Fedora-ELN/
|Latest manually generated | production | https://odcs.fedoraproject.org/composes/test/latest-Fedora-ELN/
|Latest manually generated | staging | https://odcs.stg.fedoraproject.org/composes/test/latest-Fedora-ELN/

|===

Periodic compose is generated every hour.


== Compose configuration files ==

The main Fedora ELN compose configuration file is stored in the official https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/
repository in the ``eln`` branch.

The Fedora ELN compose uses the Rawhide comps file stored in the https://pagure.io/fedora-comps repository
and also the Rawhide module-defaults stored in the https://pagure.io/releng/fedora-module-defaults/
repository.


== Generating the Fedora ELN compose ==

Members of the https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/eln-sig[eln-sig] FAS group
(and https://admin.stg.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/eln-sig[eln-sig] FAS staging group) can
generate Fedora ELN compose using the ``odcs`` command line client.

The ODCS command client is availabe in the ``odcs-client`` package:

```
$ sudo dnf install odcs-client
```

The Fedora ELN compose can then be generated by the following command on ODCS staging:

```
$ odcs --staging create-raw-config eln eln
```

Or on production ODCS:

```
$ odcs create-raw-config eln eln
```

Once the compose is generated, the JSON response is printed and the most important attribute is
the ``toplevel_url`` which points to the directory with generated compose.

[NOTE]
====

When using ODCS version &le; 0.2.39, the older syntax needs to be used to generate Fedora ELN compose:

```
odcs --staging create raw_config eln#eln
```

[NOTE]
====

When using ODCS version &ge; 0.2.46, it is possible to watch the real-time compose logs:

```
$ odcs --watch create-raw-config eln eln
```
